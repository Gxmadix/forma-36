Buttons communicate the action that will occur when the user clicks them. They contain a text label to describe the action, and an icon if appropriate.

## Button variations overview <a name="variations" />

The `Button` component can be configured in a number of different ways. Here is an overview of Contentful buttons variations.

 - Primary - Used for the most important actions in any scenario. Don’t use more than one primary button in a section or screen to avoid overwhelming users.

 ```jsx
 <>
  <Button buttonType="primary">Primary</Button>
 </>
 ```
 - Negative - For destructive actions - when something can't be undone. For example, deleting entities.
  ```jsx
 <>
  <Button buttonType="negative">Negative</Button>
 </>
 ```
 - Positive - For use when the action has a positive connotation such as creating or publishing a new entity.
   ```jsx
 <>
  <Button buttonType="positive">Positive</Button>
 </>
 ```
 - Muted - Used for a secondary actions, the most commonly used button type.
   ```jsx
 <>
  <Button buttonType="muted">Musted</Button>
 </>
 ```
 - Naked - Link button, secondary actions
   ```jsx
 <>
  <Button buttonType="naked">Naked</Button>
 </>
 ```

All of the variants are avalaible in 3 different sizes

## Usage <a name="best-practices" />

- Position buttons consistently in the interface
- Reduce complexity by using a small number of actions. Too many actions can create confusion
- Use clear, succinct, and accurate labels
- Start button labels with verbs, for example "Add field", not "New field"
- Position buttons in consistent places in the interface
- Reduce complexity by using a small number of actions. Too many actions can create confusion when having to decide 

## Writing guidelines <a name="writing-guidelines" />

- To make `Button` action-oriented, use a verb. EX: "Add field", not "New field"
- Consider what happens after a user clicks on the button and communicate that clearly in the copy. For example, “Get a UI Extension” vs “Explore all UI Extensions”
- Use clear and succinct copy

## Accessibility <a name="accessibility" />

The `Button` component is used to trigger an action or event, such as submitting a form, opening a modal, canceling an action, or performing an add or delete operation. By default `Button` component is rendered using native `<button>` element. If href attribute is provided we render `Button` as `<a>` element. In both cases Contentful button has `type="button"` provided.
